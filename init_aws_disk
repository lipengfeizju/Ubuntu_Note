1.To confirm the presence of the block volume
lsblk
fdisk -l 

2.To confirm the disk is empty
sudo file -s /dev/xvdf

3. Create a partition table
fdisk /dev/xvdf
You will see the following, type in the command as follows
   1. Command (m for help): n 
   2. Select (default p): p
   3. Partition number (1-4, default 1):1
   4. Command (m for help): w
Please don't forget the last step, otherwise your change will not be written to the disk

5.After creating the partition table, you need to update the kernel with the changes using the partprobe command
sudo partprobe /dev/xvdf

6.Next, we need to format the partition before mounting it.
sudo mkfs /dev/xvdf -t ext4
(if it says there is already one there, just let it proceed)

7. Finally, just mount the disk to the position you like
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /new_position
